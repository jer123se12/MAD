during the test, test cards that appeared x number of times in the videos you watch, or maybe top 10% of the videos you watch will be tested

3 database
1. all words
    all words pairs in the dictionary this is the only place terms and definitions are mentioned. the rest refrence from here
    schema:
        - id (autogenerated)
        - term
        - definition
        - frequency

2. seen words
    all seen words in videos
        - ref id of word
        - times seen

3. learning words
    will make it more exponential so the intervals with be 1, 2, 3, 7, 12
    if they get it wrong the go back to the first box
    all words seen in flashcards
    schema:
        - ref id of word
        - next review
        - box (1-7)

4. learnt database
    assumes all here is learnt alr, once in awhile goes back and test
    schema:
        - ref if of word
        - last reviewed date

moving between databases
layout: (function) original db -> new db: when
(create) anywhere -> all words: store words
(learning) all words -> learning words: happens when choosing flashcard learning (5 a week)
(seen) all words -> glanced words: happens when seeing word in video (times seen is updated)
(remembered) glanced -> learning: sees in weekly test and understands word (goes to box 3 or smt)
(learning) learning -> learnt: when finishes all boxes

quiz_get_words -> [(term, definition, id)]
learning_get_today -> [(term, definition, id)]

learning of new words
the words will be sorted by most commonly used

system for video

maybe search for longest words first then slowly get shorter?
then replace with space and continue
maybe can get all unique charaters and searching through that first instead of directly searching through plain text
